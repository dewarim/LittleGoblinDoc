<h2 id="infrastructure">3.1 Infrastructure</h2>
The main goal of the Little Goblin framework is to enable you to quickly turn
your ideas into a working software project. To this end, the following is provided:<p class="paragraph"/><h3>User registration</h3><p class="paragraph"/>User registration works via sending a confirmation link to the user's email address.
If the user clicks on the link therein, his account will be activated.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>License management</h3><p class="paragraph"/>Depending on the system's configuration, it's possible to let users create their own content.
In this case, you really need to get the licensing done right - as well as in the case where
you use media assets from the public domain (for example, Wikimedia). Often, the artist requires
 his name to appear in the context of the artwork - and even when there is no such request, it
 is the right and polite thing to do. And you never know when a lawyer comes a-knocking because
 someone mistakenly thinks you did use one of their images without permission.<p class="paragraph"/>Little Goblin allows you to create license objects which can be assigned to images (and perhaps
later on other assets). Currently this is implemented for monster images, which can be tagged with
a license. TODO: display licenses, not just store them - but at least the artist credit works.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Artist management</h3><p class="paragraph"/>As with licenses, you can also manage artists in Little Goblin. Currently, when a monster is displayed,
a link is shown which leads to the artist's web site. An artist may own any number of images associated
with him. TODO: public display of artist gallery<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Image management</h3><p class="paragraph"/>With the artist and licenses defined, you can assign them to images and those to one or more game assets 
(at the moment: to monsters). This way, a image can be re-used for more than one creature. While in an
ideal game, you would use images only exactly once, it may be a way for budget games to re-use them until
better and more artwork is available.<p class="paragraph"/>More than one image can be assigned to a creature and they will be used randomly, so you can add some 
visual spice for the users.  
Also, in the case of unique creatures / mobs of a certain type, it is possible to assign the generic image 
(for example: when you generate an encounter with a special named mob, it could show up with the image for "Boss mob orc",
the only difference being the mob's combat values, like in many action RPGs).<p class="paragraph"/><h3>In-Game messaging</h3><p class="paragraph"/><h4>Simple messages</h4><p class="paragraph"/>Little Goblin offers in-game messaging via a simple inbox model. Users can write messages to other characters,
and reply to them. The messages can be archived or deleted. TODO: implement sent-as-email feature<p class="paragraph"/><h4>Guild's chatterbox</h4><p class="paragraph"/>Guilds offer a special feature: a chatterbox were all guild members can exchange messages in life chat. This
is intended for non-persistent communication, as older messages will be deleted once the box fills up with new
chatter.
