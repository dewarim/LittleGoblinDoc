<h2 id="crafting">3.8 Crafting</h2>
Crafting in games can be defined as the controlled and repeatable creation of items by player characters,
 based on their personal resources (materials, skills, time).<p class="paragraph"/>The Little Goblin crafting system allows for production of all kinds of items that a character might want to use.
To create an item, a PC should have a corresponding crafting skill, the material components and the proper tools.
As with many other online games, crafting takes time - you can define how long it will take a player to create
an item.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Tools</h3><p class="paragraph"/>Many crafting systems require the presence of components, but few consider the use of multiple tools for crafting.
Little Goblin offers the chance to create recipes for items that define what other non-consumable items the player
(or, later on, his order) has to own to craft a new item.<p class="paragraph"/>At the moment, the quality of tools is not mapped to the crafted item's quality, but that could be an interesting
 idea for further extensions.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Production lines</h3><p class="paragraph"/>Currently, a player can start the production of create several items of a each kind, as long as he has the required 
components to create at least one item of this type. When the required time is up, the code checks if the resources
are available and then generates the item. 
So it is possible to start a "create 99 gold-tipped arrows, which requires 10 hours"
production task while owning only one gold nugget, and then start another process to 
"create 98 gold nuggets from gold ore in 9 hours"<p class="paragraph"/>Note: Work in progress: The crafting and the skill learning system currently rely on external "ticks", that is http calls
to the API made by a cron job, which causes specific service classes to check if items are to be generated or skills
will be learned by characters etc. This is sub-optimal and will be replaced by background-threads in the future.<p class="paragraph"/><h4>Design considerations</h4><p class="paragraph"/>A more "realistic" way would be to subtract the required resources each time an item is generated, but on the other
hand it is a better system than requiring all resources up front, which would mean that in our example the player has 
to login after 9 hours, when the 99 gold nuggets are ready, and then create the next 10 hour job of crafting the arrows.
This leads to unhealthy gaming patterns where players will stay up late or rise early, 
just to submit a task to an online game on time.<p class="paragraph"/><p class="paragraph"/>
